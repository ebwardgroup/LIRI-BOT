# LIRI-Bot

## Overview
"LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data."
LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.  For now, I have the Spotify app working and the other apps are forthcoming.  

## Usage
- First start by cloning the repo into a directory.
- Run `npm install` in the command line 
- Run commands listed below for each function of the application

Command for Spotify app: 
Enter on the command line the following text shown on the line below and add ` before and after the song name:

node liri.js spotify-this-song + `(enter song name of your choice)` 

This will search the Spotify API and return data related to the desired song. An example is below:
